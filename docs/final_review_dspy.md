# Prompt: Make dr-dspy Ready for Updated dr-llm Experiments

You are a smart implementation agent working in the `dr-dspy` repository. Use this document as your running prompt and status tracker. Your goal is to make this repository fully ready to build and run experiments on top of the updated `dr-llm` backends, using either `DrLlmDirectLM` or `DrLlmPoolLM`, while also fixing the DSPy-facing defects that would block realistic optimizer, evaluation, and experiment workflows.

Read this entire document before editing code. Also read `docs/final_review_drllm.md` before making changes because several dr-dspy fixes must preserve compatibility with the reviewed dr-llm behavior and request contracts.

## How to Work

1. Update the status table in this document as you go.
   - Set a row to `In progress` before editing that area.
   - Set it to `Done` only after code, tests, docs, and verification are complete.
   - Set it to `Blocked` only when a concrete external dependency or product decision is required.
   - Add short dated notes in the `Notes` column when useful.
2. Keep changes surgical. Preserve public behavior, diagnostics, and local patterns unless the task explicitly asks for a behavior change.
3. Prefer Pydantic `BaseModel` over dataclasses for new structured data.
4. Use the async-only public API. Pass `run=` explicitly to modules, evaluation, optimizers, adapters, and task calls.
5. Define new DSPy tasks as `TaskSpec` subclasses or via `make_task_spec`, not legacy `Signature`.
6. When using dr-llm LMs, assume v1 text-only support unless you explicitly add and test broader contract support.
7. Before committing, run the required repo gates in order:

```bash
uv run ruff check --fix
uv run ty check --fix
uv run ruff format
uv run python scripts/check_lazy_imports.py
```

All four commands must exit 0. Re-run the full sequence after any fixes.

## Desired End State

At the end of this process, `dr-dspy` should be able to run a new experiment immediately with updated `dr-llm` by using:

- `DrLlmDirectLM` for text-only `Predict`, `ChainOfThought`, `Evaluate`, and optimizer task execution through explicit `RunContext.create(lm=..., adapter=...)`.
- `DrLlmPoolLM` for cache-first single completions and explicit-session acquisition where no-replacement sampling is intentional.
- Clear docs and tests for what is supported, what is rejected, and how provider-specific dr-llm controls affect exact experiment parity.

Do not claim exact reproduction of existing `nl_latents` pool curves through `Predict(TaskSpec)` unless a raw single-message request path and provider-control parity are implemented and verified. The `nl_latents` stack used raw dr-llm requests and a separate pool-grid harness.

## Cross-Repo Context from `docs/final_review_drllm.md`

Coordinate these assumptions with the updated `dr-llm` repo:

- `DrLlmPoolLM` currently maps DSPy `LMRequest` to dr-llm `BackendRequest` fingerprints. Existing `nl_latents` pools use a different grid-seeding system and will not produce cache hits through `DrLlmPoolLM`.
- Exact `nl_latents` compression reproduction should remain dr-llm-native until dr-dspy can carry provider-specific reasoning objects and raw single-message prompt requests.
- Updated dr-llm can express provider-native controls used by T1 compression configs:
  - OpenRouter reasoning disabled: `{"kind": "openrouter", "enabled": false}`.
  - OpenRouter provider-specific effort: `{"kind": "openrouter", "effort": "low"}`.
  - OpenAI minimal thinking: `{"kind": "openai", "thinking_level": "minimal"}`.
  - Google thinking off: provider-specific thinking control from the dr-llm Google request-control layer.
- DSPy `ReasoningEffort` currently maps to generic `BackendRequest.effort`; that is not equivalent to provider-specific `BackendRequest.reasoning`.
- Pool acquisition no-replacement semantics depend on a stable session identity. Metadata does not isolate cache keys or claim cells because dr-llm fingerprints exclude metadata and extensions.
- `PoolBackend.submit_batch` plus drain remains a dr-llm-native prefill workflow. `DrLlmPoolLM` should document or expose only the workflow it actually supports.
- dr-llm v1 is text-only. Rejecting tools, multimodal parts, unsupported roles, structured response formats, stop sequences, logprobs, prompt cache, and unsupported reasoning fields is expected unless the dr-llm contract changes.

## Alignment with the dr-llm Prompt

The paired `docs/final_review_drllm.md` prompt treats this document as the consumer contract. Keep these rows aligned when updating status, writing docs, or handing work to another agent:

| dr-dspy ID | Wait for or consume this dr-llm output |
| --- | --- |
| `P0-8` | Stable dr-llm class/import names and serialized constructor fields that are safe for builtin LM state loading. |
| `P0-9` | Documented and tested `PoolBackend.aacquire(..., session_id=...)` semantics, including same-session no-replacement behavior and metadata non-isolation. |
| `P0-10` / `P2-6` | Exact `BackendRequest` field shapes for OpenRouter reasoning disabled, OpenRouter provider-specific effort, OpenAI minimal thinking, Google thinking off, `EffortSpec.MAX` if supported, and explicit no-sampling-override behavior. |
| `P0-11` | dr-llm backend close idempotency or the exact close/use-after-close expectations wrappers must enforce. |
| `P2-1` | Stable `AcquireResult(responses, claimed_from_cache, generated)` semantics and per-response provenance fields. |
| `P2-2` | Confirmation that metadata and extensions do not affect fingerprints while provider-output-affecting controls do. |
| `P2-3` | dr-llm's decision for unset `n`, `n=1`, and any native or emulated multi-completion path. |
| `P2-4` | The final typed unsupported-feature surface for the text-only v1 backend. |
| `P2-5` | Backend/provider-control guidance only; TaskSpec experiment scaffolding stays in this repo. |
| `V-2` | The exact dr-llm OpenRouter `gpt-5-nano` live-smoke fields or command that the dr-dspy live integration test should mirror. |

Do not mark a bridge-related row done if the paired dr-llm prompt has not produced enough detail to implement or test the DSPy bridge without guessing. If the dr-llm side intentionally leaves a decision to this repo, record that decision in this document's status notes before closing the row.

## Implementation Workstreams

### P0-1: Fix Public Import Cycles

Problem: Fresh-process public imports fail:

```python
from dspy.primitives import Module
from dspy.evaluate.evaluator import Evaluate
```

Known cycle:

`dspy.primitives.__getattr__("Module")` -> `dspy.primitives.module` -> `dspy.primitives.module_graph` -> `dspy.predict.protocol`, which triggers eager imports in `dspy.predict.__init__` and re-enters `dspy.predict.predict` before `Module` is available.

References:

- `dspy/primitives/__init__.py`
- `dspy/primitives/module_graph.py`
- `dspy/predict/__init__.py`

Required outcome:

- Documented public imports work in a clean process.
- Lazy imports remain compatible with `scripts/check_lazy_imports.py`.
- Add clean-process tests that would have failed before the fix.

### P0-2: Fix SIMBA and `Parallel(access_examples=False)`

Problem: `Parallel(access_examples=False)` passes `run=` to callables that do not accept it. SIMBA wraps programs in a plain async function that accepts only `example`, then passes it through this path. For real modules, the path calls `module(example, run=...)`, but `Module.__call__` expects task inputs as keyword arguments.

References:

- `dspy/runtime/batch.py`
- `dspy/teleprompt/simba_utils.py`

Required outcome:

- SIMBA `compile()` does not fail with `TypeError: wrapped_program() got an unexpected keyword argument 'run'`.
- `access_examples=False` has explicit, tested semantics for plain callables and modules.
- Add a focused SIMBA or `Parallel` regression test.

### P0-3: Align Legacy Agent Truncation Handling

Problems:

- Legacy `ReAct` does not assign `turn_log = extracted.turn_log` after `call_with_history_truncation`, so it can append to a pre-truncation log.
- `TruncationExhaustedError` subclasses `ValueError`, so legacy `ReAct` can catch it as a parse error.
- Legacy `ReAct`, `CodeAct`, and `Avatar` do not consistently handle truncation exhaustion around post-loop extract calls.

References:

- `dspy/predict/react.py`
- `dspy/history/truncation.py`
- `dspy/predict/code_act.py`
- `dspy/predict/avatar/avatar.py`

Required outcome:

- Legacy agent truncation behavior matches the safer `ReActV2` pattern.
- Truncation exhaustion is not misclassified as a parse failure.
- Add regression tests for loop and post-loop extraction paths.

### P0-4: Fix Bootstrap Threshold Semantics

Problem: Bootstrap treats `metric_threshold=0.0` as no threshold because it uses truthiness:

```python
success = metric_val >= self.metric_threshold if self.metric_threshold else metric_val
```

Reference:

- `dspy/teleprompt/bootstrap.py`

Required outcome:

- Threshold checks use `is not None`.
- Scores of exactly `0.0` and thresholds of `0.0` are handled intentionally.
- Add tests for `metric_threshold=0.0`.

### P0-5: Make `collect_trace_data` Use Normal Metric Invocation

Problem: `collect_trace_data` wraps metrics synchronously and calls `metric(example, prediction, trace)` directly. This bypasses `invoke_metric` support for async metrics and `Module` metrics.

References:

- `dspy/teleprompt/core/trace_collection.py`
- `dspy/evaluate/metric_invoke.py`

Required outcome:

- `collect_trace_data` delegates through the normal metric invocation path.
- Async metrics and module metrics work consistently with `Evaluate` and direct bootstrap paths.
- Add regression tests for async and `Module` metrics.

### P0-6: Thread `run=` Through GEPA Proposal Paths

Problems:

- `SingleComponentMultiModalProposer` calls `Predict` without `run=`.
- `MultiModalInstructionProposer` calls a module wrapper without `run=`.
- The custom proposer branch creates `opt_run` but does not pass it to the proposer.

References:

- `dspy/integrations/optimizers/gepa/instruction_proposal.py`
- `dspy/integrations/optimizers/gepa/adapter.py`

Required outcome:

- Strict transparency works for multimodal GEPA instruction proposals and custom async proposers.
- `AsyncProposalFn` call sites receive the configured optimizer run.
- Add focused strict-transparency tests.

### P0-7: Make Disk Call-Log Sessions Unique

Problem: `create_run_log_session` uses second-resolution UTC timestamps and `exist_ok=True`, so independent runs created in the same second can share `run.json` and `calls.jsonl`. `DrLlmPoolLM` may derive session IDs from this timestamp.

References:

- `dspy/runtime/run_log_session.py`
- `dspy/clients/dr_llm/pool.py`

Required outcome:

- Multiple `RunContext.create(...)` calls in the same second create distinct log directories.
- Existing log path readability remains straightforward.
- dr-llm pool session derivation does not collide for independent disk-logged runs.
- Add a collision regression test.

### P0-8: Allow Safe State Loading for Builtin dr-llm LMs

Problem: `DrLlmDirectLM` and `DrLlmPoolLM` are listed as builtin LM classes and dump normal state under `dspy.clients.dr_llm.*`, but `BaseLM.load_state` rejects every class path except `dspy.clients.lm.LM` unless `allow_custom_lm_class=True`.

References:

- `dspy/clients/lm_registry.py`
- `dspy/clients/base_lm.py`
- `dspy/clients/dr_llm/base.py`

Required outcome:

- Saved programs using builtin dr-llm LMs reload through the normal safe path.
- Custom LM loading remains protected.
- The safe-load allowlist is based on dr-llm-confirmed builtin class/import names and serialized constructor fields.
- Add direct and pool `dump_state`/`load_state` round-trip tests.

### P0-9: Make Pool Acquisition Session Identity Explicit and Safe

Problem: `resolve_pool_session_id` uses disk log session when present, then LM-level `session_id`, then a fresh `uuid4()` per call. This can either collide when disk sessions collide or reset no-replacement semantics across repeated calls when no stable session is configured.

References:

- `dspy/runtime/run_log_session.py`
- `dspy/clients/dr_llm/pool.py`
- `tests/clients/dr_llm/test_integration_pool.py`

Required outcome:

- No-session fallback behavior is explicit and tested.
- Repeated `acquire_samples(...)` calls have intentional no-replacement semantics only when a stable session is configured.
- Docs tell experiment authors to pass an explicit stable session identity unless disk logging is known-safe.
- The wrapper behavior matches the dr-llm prompt's final `PoolBackend.aacquire(..., session_id=...)` contract, including metadata non-isolation.
- Direct `aforward` remains cache-first and unaffected.

### P0-10: Bridge Provider-Specific dr-llm Reasoning and Config Controls

Problem: Last-week compression configs rely on provider-native dr-llm controls that current dr-dspy cannot represent. Current mapping places DSPy `reasoning.effort` on generic `BackendRequest.effort` and hard-codes `BackendRequest.reasoning=None`.

Required controls to support or explicitly reject with clear guidance:

- OpenRouter reasoning disabled.
- OpenRouter provider-specific effort.
- OpenAI minimal thinking.
- Google thinking off.
- dr-llm `EffortSpec.MAX` if the updated dr-llm contract exposes it for relevant providers.
- Explicit empty sampling controls when needed to suppress provider defaults.

References:

- `dspy/clients/dr_llm/base.py`
- `dspy/clients/dr_llm/mapping.py`
- `dspy/clients/dr_llm/contract.py`
- `../nl_latents/src/nl_latents/sampling/llm/catalog.py`
- `../dr-llm/src/dr_llm/backends/models.py`
- `../dr-llm/src/dr_llm/llm/config.py`

- `../dr-llm/src/dr_llm/llm/providers/impls/google/request_controls.py`

Required outcome:

- Decide and implement a clear public surface for dr-llm-native provider controls, or document a deliberate non-goal and preserve typed rejection.
- Default T1 compression configs can be represented faithfully through dr-dspy only if provider-specific request parity is implemented.
- Use the exact request field shapes handed off by the dr-llm prompt; do not duplicate provider payload construction in dr-dspy when a dr-llm helper or model should own it.
- Add mapping and contract tests that compare expected `BackendRequest` fields for the default T1 model-control cases.
- Do not silently approximate provider-specific reasoning with generic `effort`.

### P0-11: Fix `DrLlmPoolLM` Lifecycle

Problems:

- `BaseLM.copy()` is shallow, so copied `DrLlmPoolLM` wrappers share `_backend` while `_closed` remains per wrapper.
- Closing a copy and then the original can close the same backend twice.
- `aforward` and `acquire_samples` do not check `_closed` before delegating to the backend.

References:

- `dspy/clients/base_lm.py`
- `dspy/clients/dr_llm/pool.py`
- `dspy/predict/sampling.py`
- `dspy/teleprompt/simba_utils.py`
- `../dr-llm/src/dr_llm/backends/pool.py`

Required outcome:

- Pool LM copies cannot accidentally double-close or use a torn-down backend.
- Calls after close fail clearly.
- If dr-llm `PoolBackend.close()` is made idempotent, still keep the wrapper state coherent.
- If dr-llm documents non-idempotent or resource-specific close behavior, enforce the wrapper-side guard explicitly and test it.
- Add focused lifecycle tests.

### P1-1: Fix OpenAI Reasoning-Model Validation

Problem: The reasoning-model constructor guard uses truthiness, so `temperature=0.0` passes even though only `1.0` or `None` should be accepted. `LM.copy(temperature=0.0)` can bypass the reasoning-specific constructor rule.

References:

- `dspy/clients/lm/client.py`
- `dspy/clients/base_lm.py`

Required outcome:

- Validate `temperature is not None and temperature != 1.0`.
- Validate `max_tokens is not None and max_tokens < 16000` where that rule applies.
- `LM.copy(...)` preserves reasoning-model validation.
- Add tests for constructor and copy paths.

### P1-2: Wire or Clarify LiteLLM Provider Options

Problem: `LMProviderOptions.cache` and `max_retries` are currently no-ops on the LiteLLM path. The client always passes no-cache/no-store, and only `LM.num_retries` controls retries.

References:

- `dspy/clients/lm/client.py`
- `dspy/core/types/lm_provider.py`

Required outcome:

- Either wire these options through correctly or reject/document unsupported combinations clearly.
- Strict transparency audit data should not claim a setting that is ignored at execution.
- Add tests for cache and retry behavior or validation.

### P1-3: Improve Strict Transparency First-Run Ergonomics

Problem: `TelemetryConfig.transparency` defaults to strict. Bare `LM("openai/gpt-4o-mini")` leaves `temperature`, `max_tokens`, and `provider_options.cache` unset, so adapter calls can fail unless callers construct a fully explicit `RunContext`. dr-llm LMs cannot use `provider_options`, which makes cache-related checks awkward.

References:

- `dspy/runtime/config.py`
- `dspy/runtime/transparency/validate.py`
- `dspy/clients/lm/client.py`
- `dspy/clients/dr_llm/base.py`

Required outcome:

- First-run strict transparency errors are actionable.
- Examples and constructors make required configuration obvious.
- dr-llm strict transparency checks align with the dr-llm configuration surface.

### P1-4: Add Timeout Protection to Generated-Code Execution

Problem: `PythonInterpreter.execute` synchronously waits on Deno/Pyodide response loops. `read_until_response` caps skipped non-JSON lines but has no wall-clock timeout. `CodeAct`, `ProgramOfThought`, and RLM call this path directly.

References:

- `dspy/primitives/python_interpreter/interpreter.py`
- `dspy/primitives/python_interpreter/pump.py`
- `dspy/predict/code_act.py`
- `dspy/predict/program_of_thought.py`
- `dspy/predict/rlm/execution.py`

Required outcome:

- Generated code cannot hang an async DSPy run indefinitely.
- Timeout behavior is explicit and tested.

### P1-5: Add Bounded Finetuning Waits and HTTP Timeouts

Problems:

- Databricks finetuning poll loop exits only on `"Completed"` or `"Failed"` and has no training timeout.
- Several Databricks deployment HTTP requests omit request timeouts.
- OpenAI finetune `wait_for_job` treats unknown statuses as pending with no max duration.

References:

- `dspy/integrations/finetune/databricks.py`
- `dspy/integrations/finetune/openai.py`

Required outcome:

- Poll loops are bounded and report unknown/stuck states clearly.
- External HTTP requests have explicit timeouts.
- Add tests with fake provider clients.

### P1-6: Route `run_with_trace` Through the Normal Module Spine

Problem: `run_with_trace` calls `program.aforward(...)` directly instead of `await program(...)`, skipping module call-scope setup, callbacks, and top-level usage tracking.

Reference:

- `dspy/runtime/optimization_trace.py`

Required outcome:

- Tracing preserves normal module observability.
- Bootstrap, SIMBA, Refine, and trace collection still work.
- Add a callback or usage-tracking regression test.

### P1-7: Improve `run_bounded` Abort Accounting

Problem: When `max_errors` triggers cancellation, never-started items remain pending and are finalized as `None`. They are absent from `stats.failed_indices` and `exceptions_map`, so `Parallel` does not record them as failures.

References:

- `dspy/runtime/async_parallel.py`
- `dspy/runtime/batch.py`

Required outcome:

- Aborted, never-started, failed, and successful items are represented distinctly.
- `Parallel` exposes structured partial state without hiding missing work.
- Add cancellation/accounting tests.

### P1-8: Isolate or Document Concurrent Call Logs

Problems:

- `fork_worker_run` isolates worker `RunContext` state, but workers share LM and program objects.
- `record_call` appends to shared bounded ring buffers on `lm.call_log` and module `call_log` without per-worker isolation.
- Optimizer forks preserve shared call-log state rather than isolating teacher or candidate run logs.

References:

- `dspy/runtime/run_fork.py`
- `dspy/runtime/call_log/coordinator.py`
- `dspy/runtime/batch.py`
- `dspy/runtime/run_context.py`
- `dspy/runtime/run_log_policy.py`

Required outcome:

- Concurrent call-log behavior is either isolated or clearly documented as shared best-effort.
- `run.inspect_call_log()` remains the recommended reliable view under concurrency.
- Add tests if behavior changes.

### P1-9: Handle Empty `Evaluate` Devsets

Problem: `Evaluate` computes a defensive `mean_pct` for empty devsets, then returns `EvaluationResult(score=round(100 * score_sum / ntotal, 2), ...)`, causing `ZeroDivisionError`.

Reference:

- `dspy/evaluate/evaluator.py`

Required outcome:

- `Evaluate(devset=[])` returns a clear validation error or an explicit empty-result score by design.
- Add a regression test.

### P1-10: Handle Empty Answer Lists in Metrics

Problem: `max_em_score` and `max_token_f1_score` call `max()` over `answers_list` without guarding empty lists.

Reference:

- `dspy/evaluate/metrics.py`

Required outcome:

- Empty reference answer lists produce a clear validation error or a defined zero score.
- Add tests.

### P1-11: Surface Sampling Threshold Misses

Problem: `BestOfN` and `Refine` return the highest-reward prediction when no sample meets the threshold, without a failure flag, exception, or metadata indicating the miss.

References:

- `dspy/predict/sampling.py`
- `dspy/predict/best_of_n.py`
- `dspy/predict/refine.py`

Required outcome:

- Callers can tell whether the threshold was met.
- Existing early-stop behavior remains intact.
- Add tests for threshold misses.

### P1-12: Avoid Accidental Parent Trace Mutation During Sampling

Problem: `sample_with_reward` extends the parent run's `optimization_trace` with the winning attempt trace. Repeated `Refine` or `BestOfN` calls can accumulate attempt traces and evict older entries.

Reference:

- `dspy/predict/sampling.py`

Required outcome:

- Decide whether this mutation is intentional. If not, isolate or record it explicitly.
- Add tests for trace contents after repeated sampling.

### P1-13: Revisit JSON Parsing Strictness

Problem: `JSONAdapter` defaults `allow_json_repair=True`, and top-level parse failures can extract the first `{...}` substring from larger completions.

References:

- `dspy/adapters/json_adapter.py`
- `dspy/adapters/utils/json_loads.py`

Required outcome:

- Decide whether strict parsing should be the default under strict transparency.
- If permissive repair remains default, document it and add tests for multiple JSON blobs or prose-wrapped JSON.

### P1-14: Preserve Mixed MCP Tool Results

Problem: Mixed MCP tool results with text plus non-text content can collapse to a string and drop non-text content. Error-only non-text payloads can produce effectively empty `RuntimeError` messages.

Reference:

- `dspy/integrations/mcp.py`

Required outcome:

- Non-text MCP result content and useful error diagnostics are preserved or rejected clearly.
- Add conversion tests.

### P1-15: Improve Persistence Failure Modes

Problems:

- `apply_module_state` raises a bare `KeyError` for missing predictors and silently ignores extra predictor state.
- `save_program` writes pickle before metadata, so metadata failure leaves an unloadable directory.

References:

- `dspy/persistence/state.py`
- `dspy/persistence/program.py`

Required outcome:

- State/schema mismatch errors are actionable.
- Program save is atomic enough to avoid partial unloadable directories, or cleanup is explicit.
- Add tests for missing/extra predictor state and metadata-write failure.

### P2-1: Surface Pool Acquire Aggregate Provenance

Problem: dr-llm returns `AcquireResult(responses, claimed_from_cache, generated)`, but `DrLlmPoolLM.acquire_samples` returns only `list[LMResponse]`.

Reference:

- `dspy/clients/dr_llm/pool.py`

Required outcome:

- Decide whether to expose aggregate provenance directly, record it in telemetry, or document how to reconstruct it from per-response provider data.
- Preserve the dr-llm `AcquireResult(responses, claimed_from_cache, generated)` meaning if exposing aggregate data through DSPy.
- Preserve per-response provenance in `provider_data`.

### P2-2: Document Pool Fingerprint and Metadata Behavior

Problem: DSPy forwards `LMRequest.metadata` into `BackendRequest.metadata`, while dr-llm fingerprints exclude metadata and extensions. Users may incorrectly expect metadata to isolate cache keys or acquisition cells.

References:

- `dspy/clients/dr_llm/mapping.py`
- `../dr-llm/src/dr_llm/backends/fingerprint.py`

Required outcome:

- Docs state that metadata is not cache or claim isolation.
- Tests reflect the dr-llm fingerprint contract: metadata and extensions do not affect fingerprints, provider-output-affecting controls do.
- Experiments that need isolation should change generation-relevant request fields, pool namespace/config, or session identity as appropriate.

### P2-3: Handle dr-llm `n=1` Contract for Optimizer Proposal Paths

Problem: The dr-llm contract rejects any non-`None` `config.n`, including `LMConfig(n=1)`, while the error says `n>1` is unsupported. MIPRO grounded proposer and dataset-summary paths use `n=1`; COPRO proposal calls use `n=breadth-1`.

References:

- `dspy/clients/dr_llm/contract.py`
- `dspy/teleprompt/copro_optimizer.py`
- `dspy/propose/grounded_proposer.py`
- `dspy/propose/dataset_summary_generator.py`

Required outcome:

- Allow `n=1` if dr-llm semantics are identical to unset `n`, or reject it with an exact error and document optimizer limitations.
- COPRO breadth should either use a supported alternate LM, emulated loop, native multi-completion support, or a clear typed rejection.
- Match dr-llm's documented `n` behavior instead of inventing DSPy-only semantics.
- Add contract and optimizer-path tests.

### P2-4: Document and Test dr-llm v1 Supported Scope

Problem: The mapping layer correctly rejects unsupported features, but users need clear boundaries.

Expected supported fit:

- Text-only `Predict`.
- Text-only `ChainOfThought`.
- `Evaluate` with text-only programs.
- Direct `aforward` and pool cache/acquire flows.

Expected unsupported v1 scope:

- `ReAct`, `ReActV2`, `CodeAct`, and tool agents.
- Multimodal programs.
- Tool-call history.
- Native structured-output paths.
- Stop sequences, logprobs, prompt cache, unsupported roles, unsupported reasoning fields.

Required outcome:

- Docs and tests make the support matrix obvious.
- Rejections are typed and actionable.
- The support matrix matches the final dr-llm v1 unsupported-feature surface.

### P2-5: Add or Document the `nl-code` TaskSpec Experiment Path

Problem: `nl-code` is the realistic DSPy reproduction target because it already used DSPy-style programs and optimizers, but it still needs a port from legacy `Signature` and global `dspy.configure(lm=...)` to `TaskSpec` plus explicit `RunContext`.

Required outcome:

- Provide a minimal experiment scaffold or documentation showing:
  - HumanEval/code-spec TaskSpecs.
  - Generator modules.
  - Metrics.
  - Split wiring.
  - Optimizer configuration.
  - `DrLlmDirectLM` plus adapter setup.
- Make clear whether pool use is an intentional new experiment condition rather than a reproduction path.
- Do not claim bit-exact parity until LiteLLM-vs-dr-llm wire differences and provider reasoning controls are matched.

### P2-6: Track Advanced Provider Option Gaps

Known gaps:

- DSPy `ReasoningEffort` stops at `high`; dr-llm may expose `EffortSpec.MAX`.
- Custom `registry=` is accepted at construction but is not serialized in `dump_state`, so restored programs rebuild the default registry.
- OpenRouter reasoning-off, GPT-5 minimal thinking, OpenRouter provider-specific effort, and explicit empty sampling controls are required for exact experiment parity.

References:

- `dspy/core/types/lm_config.py`
- `dspy/clients/dr_llm/base.py`
- `dspy/clients/dr_llm/mapping.py`
- `../dr-llm/src/dr_llm/llm/names.py`

Required outcome:

- Either implement these controls or document them as non-goals for the current release.
- Tie each implemented or deferred control back to the exact dr-llm field, helper, or explicit non-goal.
- Add tests for any implemented serialization or mapping behavior.

### P2-7: Address Smaller DSPy Footguns Where In Scope

Known issues:

- `PredictOptions.trace` defaults to `True`, so every `Predict` appends to `optimization_trace` unless callers pass `trace=False`.
- Legacy `ReAct` ignores caller `turn_log` and always starts from `TurnLog.empty()`, unlike `ReActV2`.
- `Refine` and `BestOfN` default `fail_count=num_samples`, so transient LM/parse failures can consume the sample budget.
- `module.deepcopy()` falls back to shallow/reference copies with a warning only; sampling isolation can break when deep copy fails.
- Callback handler exceptions are swallowed and logged as warnings, so observability hooks can fail silently.
- `to_jsonable` in non-strict mode stringifies unknown types in audit logs without error.
- `collect_trace_data(..., raise_on_error=False)` can drop failed examples and return a shorter list than the input.
- GEPA sync bridge helpers intentionally raise from an active event loop, making sync adapter entry points awkward in async notebooks and apps.

Required outcome:

- Fix items that materially block the dr-llm experiment target or optimizer reliability.
- Otherwise document the behavior and add targeted tests where a future regression would be costly.

## Verification Matrix

At minimum, add or update tests for these gaps as the corresponding workstreams are completed:

| Area | Required verification |
| --- | --- |
| Public imports | Clean-process import tests for `from dspy.primitives import Module` and `from dspy.evaluate.evaluator import Evaluate`. |
| SIMBA | Compile or focused `Parallel(access_examples=False)` regression test. |
| Legacy agents | Truncation-exhaustion tests for `ReAct`, `CodeAct`, and `Avatar`. |
| Bootstrap | `metric_threshold=0.0` and metric result exactly `0.0`. |
| Trace collection | Async metric and `Module` metric through `collect_trace_data`. |
| GEPA | Strict `run=` tests for multimodal and custom proposer paths. |
| Runtime logging | Multiple disk log sessions created in one second produce distinct directories. |
| Parallel concurrency | Call-log behavior under concurrent workers is tested or documented. |
| Evaluation | Empty devset behavior. |
| Metrics | Empty reference answer-list behavior. |
| dr-llm direct | `Predict` + `JSONAdapter` + `DrLlmDirectLM` + `RunContext` happy-path test. |
| dr-llm state | Direct and pool `dump_state`/`load_state` round trips. |
| dr-llm pool acquire | No-session fallback and explicit-session no-replacement behavior. |
| dr-llm mapping | Provider-specific reasoning/config cases for the default T1 controls, if implemented. |
| dr-llm lifecycle | Pool copy/close/use-after-close behavior. |
| dr-llm contract | `LMConfig(n=1)` behavior and optimizer proposal paths. |
| Live OpenRouter endpoint | A live test that uses the local `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, calls OpenRouter with `gpt-5-nano` through the dr-dspy dr-llm integration, and verifies a non-empty model result plus expected OpenRouter/provider metadata. |

Useful existing focused checks from the review:

- `from dspy.primitives import Module` failed in a fresh process.
- Multiple disk `RunContext.create(...)` calls in the same second produced one unique log directory.
- `LM("openai/gpt-5-mini", temperature=0.0, max_tokens=16000)` was accepted.
- `Evaluate(devset=[])` raised `ZeroDivisionError`.
- dr-llm client tests passed:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/clients/dr_llm/test_contract.py tests/clients/dr_llm/test_mapping.py tests/clients/dr_llm/test_direct_lm.py tests/clients/dr_llm/test_pool_lm.py tests/clients/dr_llm/test_dr_llm_errors.py -q
```

Postgres integration checks were skipped during review because no integration DSN was configured. Do not require Postgres integration for ordinary unit verification, but document any integration command that would strengthen confidence when a DSN is available.

The final plan must include a non-optional live provider smoke test for OpenRouter `gpt-5-nano`. The local environment is expected to provide `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`. Add a dedicated live test, mark it with the repo's live-LLM marker convention, and run it before marking `V-1` or `V-2` done. The test should actually hit the OpenRouter endpoint through `DrLlmDirectLM` or the direct dr-llm request path used by the bridge, assert that the response content is non-empty, and assert provider/provenance metadata strongly enough to catch accidental routing through a different provider.

Mirror the final dr-llm live-smoke handoff where possible: use the same OpenRouter model identity, provider-specific controls, and provenance expectations, then run through the dr-dspy integration surface. A dr-llm CLI smoke test alone does not satisfy `V-2`.

## Experiment Readiness Checklist

Before marking `V-1` done, verify the repository supports or clearly rejects these immediate experiment flows:

- Direct backend text-only run:
  - Create `DrLlmDirectLM("openai/gpt-4.1-mini", temperature=0.0, max_tokens=4000)`.
  - Create an explicit `RunContext` with `JSONAdapter` or `XMLAdapter`.
  - Run a `TaskSpec`-based `Predict` or `ChainOfThought`.
  - Run `Evaluate` over a non-empty devset.
- Live OpenRouter endpoint run:
  - Require `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in the environment; do not silently skip this check when declaring the full plan tested.
  - Call `gpt-5-nano` through OpenRouter, for example `DrLlmDirectLM("openrouter/openai/gpt-5-nano", ...)` with the provider-specific controls supported by the final bridge.
  - Verify the call reaches OpenRouter, returns non-empty text, and records provider/provenance metadata.
  - Record the exact live-test command and result in this document's status notes.
- Pool backend cache-first run:
  - Create `DrLlmPoolLM(..., pool_config=...)`.
  - Use `aforward` for cache-first single completions.
  - Close the pool cleanly or use it as a context manager.
- Pool acquisition run:
  - Pass an explicit stable `session_id` or resolver.
  - Use `acquire_samples` only when no-replacement sampling is intended.
  - Confirm generated/cache provenance is available or documented.
- Optimizer run:
  - Use `DrLlmDirectLM` for task calls where supported.
  - Use a separate supported proposal LM when optimizer proposal paths require unsupported `n>1` or provider features, unless those paths have been fixed.
  - Pass `run=` through all module, optimizer, and metric calls.
- Exact `nl_latents` reproduction:
  - Keep on raw dr-llm/nl_latents infrastructure unless raw prompt and provider-control parity are explicitly implemented.
  - Do not use `Predict(TaskSpec)` for bit-exact encoder/decoder pool curves.

## Final Handoff Requirements

When you finish the implementation:

1. Update every relevant status row and note any intentionally deferred work.
2. Run the required commit gates.
3. Run focused tests for changed areas.
4. Run the live OpenRouter `gpt-5-nano` test with `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` set and record the result. If the key is unavailable or the endpoint is down, mark the plan blocked rather than fully tested.
5. Summarize the final supported dr-llm experiment path in docs or examples.
6. Commit only the intended changes.
