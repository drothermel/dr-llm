# Prompt: Make dr-llm Ready for dr-dspy Direct and Pool Experiments

You are a smart coding agent working in the `dr-llm` repository, currently located at `../dr-llm` relative to this `dr-dspy` checkout. Use this document as your working prompt and status tracker. Update the status tables in this file as you work so a reviewer can tell what is done, what changed, what remains blocked, and which verification commands passed.

The paired DSPy-side review is in `../dr-dspy/docs/final_review_dspy.md`. Read it before editing code. Your goal is not to reproduce every DSPy bugfix inside `dr-llm`; your goal is to make `dr-llm` expose clear, stable backend behavior and provider controls so the updated `dr-dspy` integration can immediately run text-only experiments through either `DrLlmDirectLM` or `DrLlmPoolLM`.

## Alignment with the dr-dspy Prompt

The `dr-dspy` prompt is the consumer of this work. Keep these workstream IDs aligned when updating this document and when writing the final handoff:

| dr-dspy ID | dr-dspy need | dr-llm-side output expected from this prompt |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `P0-8` | Safe state loading for builtin dr-llm LMs | Confirm stable class/import names and serialized constructor fields that `dr-dspy` should allow through its safe load path. |
| `P0-9` | Pool acquisition session identity | Document and test `PoolBackend.aacquire(..., session_id=...)` semantics, including same-session no-replacement behavior and metadata non-isolation. |
| `P0-10` / `P2-6` | Provider-specific reasoning/config bridge | Provide exact `BackendRequest` field shapes for OpenRouter reasoning disabled, OpenRouter provider-specific effort, OpenAI minimal thinking, Google thinking off, `EffortSpec.MAX` if supported, and explicit no-sampling-override behavior. |
| `P0-11` | Pool lifecycle | Verify or implement idempotent backend close and preserve clear expectations for use after close. |
| `P2-1` | Pool aggregate provenance | Preserve `AcquireResult(responses, claimed_from_cache, generated)` and per-response provenance so `dr-dspy` can expose or record it. |
| `P2-2` | Pool fingerprint and metadata docs | Test or document that metadata and extensions do not affect fingerprints, while provider-output-affecting controls do. |
| `P2-3` | `n=1` optimizer contract | State whether `dr-llm` treats single-completion requests as unset `n`, rejects them, or supports a native/emulated multi-completion path. |
| `P2-4` | dr-llm v1 scope docs/tests | Keep unsupported feature errors early and typed for text-only DSPy wrappers. |
| `P2-5` | `nl-code` TaskSpec experiment scaffold | Provide backend/provider-control guidance only; the TaskSpec scaffold itself remains a `dr-dspy` responsibility. |
| `V-2` | Live OpenRouter `gpt-5-nano` endpoint test | Ensure the dr-llm OpenRouter path works with `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, and hand off the exact fields/command needed for the dr-dspy live integration test. |

Do not mark a dr-llm phase done if its output leaves the corresponding dr-dspy workstream without enough detail to implement or test the bridge. If a decision belongs in `dr-dspy`, state that explicitly and give the dr-dspy agent the exact contract it should code against.

## Target Outcome

At the end of this work:

- `dr-llm` can express the provider-specific controls required by the reviewed compression experiments, especially OpenRouter reasoning-off, OpenRouter provider-specific reasoning effort, OpenAI minimal thinking, Google thinking-off, ordinary sampling controls, and an explicit "no sampling override" case.
- `dr-dspy` can map its updated direct and pool wrappers onto those `dr-llm` controls without guessing, falling back to lossy generic `effort`, or changing cache fingerprints unexpectedly.
- Direct experiments can run through `DrLlmDirectLM` with explicit `RunContext`, adapter, model controls, and audit logs.
- Pool experiments can run through `DrLlmPoolLM` with stable acquisition session identity, clear cache/fingerprint behavior, and predictable lifecycle behavior.
- Exact `nl_latents` compression-curve reproduction remains on the raw `nl_latents` plus `dr-llm` harness until a raw single-message request path exists in `dr-dspy`; do not claim DSPy `Predict(TaskSpec)` prompts are bit-equivalent to those pools.
- The repository contains tests or docs that prevent future drift on these boundaries.

## Required Context

Read these before implementing:

- `../dr-dspy/docs/final_review_dspy.md`
- `../dr-dspy/docs/final_review_drllm.md` after you start editing this prompt as your tracker
- `src/dr_llm/backends/models.py`

- `../nl_latents/src/nl_latents/sampling/encoder/request.py`
- `../nl_latents/src/nl_latents/sampling/decoder/request.py`

## Working Rules

- Make the smallest coherent `dr-llm` changes that let `dr-dspy` integrate cleanly. Do not redesign experiment harnesses unless the existing surface cannot support the required request shapes.
- Preserve `dr-llm` as the source of truth for provider-native controls. `dr-dspy` should adapt to this API, not duplicate provider-specific payload construction.
- Keep raw `nl_latents` pool reproduction separate from DSPy prompt generation unless you add and test a raw request path explicitly.
- Add regression tests for behavior changes. If a check needs Postgres or live provider credentials, add a skipped integration test or document the exact command and blocker.
- Update the status table and the "Implementation Log" as each phase completes.

## Phase 1: Establish the Cross-Repo Contract

Status: `done`

Write down, in code comments, docs, or tests as appropriate, the contract between `dr-llm` and `dr-dspy`:

- `dr-llm` owns provider/model routing, provider-native reasoning controls, provider-native sampling controls, backend request validation, fingerprinting, pool acquisition semantics, and aggregate acquire provenance.
- `dr-dspy` owns `TaskSpec`/adapter prompt rendering, DSPy `LMRequest` to `BackendRequest` mapping, transparency/audit logging, `RunContext`, and DSPy optimizer call behavior.
- Metadata may flow from DSPy into `BackendRequest.metadata`, but metadata and extensions must not become cache-key or claim-isolation fields unless a deliberate breaking change is made.
- Exact `nl_latents` pool replication uses raw single-user-message prompts and the existing `dr-llm`/`nl_latents` pool harness; DSPy `Predict(TaskSpec)` prompt shape is a different experiment condition.

Acceptance checks:

- There is a discoverable doc or test assertion that states metadata is not included in the backend fingerprint.
- There is a discoverable doc or test assertion that states session identity, not metadata, controls no-replacement acquisition grouping.
- There is a note for `dr-dspy` maintainers listing the exact `dr-llm` request fields they should map for provider-specific reasoning and sampling.

## Phase 2: Preserve and Expose Provider-Specific Controls

Status: `done`

The reviewed compression experiments used these request controls:

| Config family | Model string | Required provider-native controls |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MiMo off | `openrouter/xiaomi/mimo-v2-flash` | OpenRouter `reasoning.enabled=false`, `temperature=0.7`, `top_p=0.95` |
| Nemotron off | `openrouter/nvidia/llama-3.3-nemotron-super-49b-v1.5` | OpenRouter `reasoning.enabled=false`, `temperature=0.7`, `top_p=0.95` |
| GPT-OSS low | `openrouter/openai/gpt-oss-20b` | OpenRouter provider-specific `reasoning.effort=low`, not generic backend `effort` |
| GPT-5 nano low through OpenRouter | `openrouter/openai/gpt-5-nano` | OpenRouter provider-specific `reasoning.effort=low`, not generic backend `effort` |
| GPT-5 nano minimal through OpenAI | `openai/gpt-5-nano` | OpenAI `thinking_level=minimal`, no sampling override |
| Gemini flash-lite off | `google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite` | Google `thinking_level=off`, `temperature=0.7`, `top_p=0.95` |

Implementation guidance:

- Verify that current `BackendRequest.reasoning` and provider request-control models can represent every row above without lossy conversion.
- If the existing public model is too awkward for `dr-dspy`, add a small explicit construction or parsing helper in `dr-llm` rather than making `dr-dspy` know provider internals.
- Make sure "provider-specific reasoning effort" is distinct from generic `BackendRequest.effort`. The reviewed OpenRouter GPT-5 nano and GPT-OSS requests must not be represented as generic backend effort.
- Preserve an explicit way to suppress provider-default sampling overrides when a catalog entry means "no sampling override".
- Confirm whether `EffortSpec.MAX` is intentionally supported and document how callers should request it. DSPy's current generic `ReasoningEffort` stops at `high`, so a provider-native bridge may be needed for `max`.

Acceptance checks:

- Add or update tests that build the six request families above and verify provider payload controls without live API calls.
- Add a small parity test or fixture comparing `nl_latents` catalog request construction with direct `dr-llm` request construction for the five default T1 configs.
- If you cannot add the parity test inside `dr-llm` because it would depend on `nl_latents`, document the exact external parity command and expected payload fields.

## Phase 3: Make Pool Acquisition Semantics Hard to Misuse

Status: `done`

`PoolBackend.aacquire(request, session_id, n)` implements no-replacement sampling by session. The unsafe behavior happens when callers accidentally reuse a session across independent experiments or accidentally generate a new session for repeated calls in one experiment.

Implementation guidance:

- Ensure docs and tests make `session_id` mandatory in spirit, even if the API can accept a generated value through a wrapper.
- Explain that `session_id` controls acquisition state and metadata does not.
- Confirm whether `PoolBackend` should reject empty session IDs or normalize them consistently.
- Add examples for stable experiment session IDs, for example `experiment-name:split:seed` or a caller-provided run ID.
- Coordinate with the DSPy-side fix: `dr-dspy` should stop relying on second-resolution log timestamps for unique pool acquisition sessions.

Acceptance checks:

- A test or doc example demonstrates two calls with the same `session_id` claiming without replacement.
- A test or doc example demonstrates that different `session_id` values do not share claim state.
- A doc note warns against deriving session IDs from low-resolution timestamps.

## Phase 4: Clarify Pool Batch Fill Versus Cache-First Calls

Status: `done`

`PoolBackend` supports a native batch-fill workflow with `submit_batch`, drain, and then acquire. `DrLlmPoolLM.aforward` is cache-first single-completion behavior; on a miss it generates and inserts one response. These are different experiment workflows.

Implementation guidance:

- Keep batch pre-fill as a direct `dr-llm` workflow unless you intentionally add a higher-level wrapper.
- Document the lifecycle: seed or submit a request grid, drain workers, acquire with a stable session ID, aggregate results.
- Document that `DrLlmPoolLM` does not reproduce `nl_latents` grid axes, encoder-to-decoder lineage, budget bindings, compression baselines, or curve aggregation.

Acceptance checks:

- There is a minimal docs example for direct `PoolBackend` batch-fill and acquire.
- There is a clear contrast between `PoolBackend` batch-fill and wrapper-level cache-first `aforward`.

## Phase 5: Stabilize Pool Lifecycle and Provenance

Status: `done`

The DSPy review found that shallow-copied `DrLlmPoolLM` wrappers can share a backend while each wrapper tracks its own `_closed` flag. `dr-dspy` should guard against use-after-close, but `dr-llm` can reduce blast radius by making backend teardown robust.

Implementation guidance:

- Verify whether `PoolBackend.close()` is idempotent. If not, make it idempotent.
- Verify whether async close/drain paths are safe to call multiple times or after partial initialization.
- Preserve `AcquireResult(responses, claimed_from_cache, generated)` semantics. `dr-dspy` may expose or log aggregate provenance later, so avoid changing field names without a coordinated update.
- Ensure per-response provenance such as cache/provider source remains available in response metadata or provider data.

Acceptance checks:

- Add or update a unit test for calling close twice.
- Add or update a unit test that acquire provenance counts distinguish cache claims from generated responses.
- If close-after-use behavior depends on external resources, document expected exceptions.

## Phase 6: Fingerprint and Metadata Contract

Status: `done`

The current desired behavior is that generation-relevant request fields define `request_fingerprint`, while metadata and extensions do not. This lets run-specific tags avoid fragmenting the cache.

Implementation guidance:

- Confirm the fingerprint excludes `metadata` and `extensions`.
- Confirm the fingerprint includes provider/model, messages, generation controls, provider-native reasoning controls, and any other fields that can affect model output.
- If provider-specific reasoning controls are added or re-shaped, make sure they are included in the fingerprint.

Acceptance checks:

- A test proves two requests differing only by metadata share a fingerprint.
- A test proves two requests differing by provider-specific reasoning controls do not share a fingerprint.
- Docs warn that metadata is not claim isolation.

## Phase 7: Document dr-llm v1 Scope for DSPy Callers

Status: `done`

The first stable `dr-dspy` bridge should target text-only programs:

- Expected fit: `Predict`, `ChainOfThought`, `Evaluate`, text-only metrics, and explicit `RunContext` with `JSONAdapter` or `XMLAdapter`.
- Not supported through v1 backends: tools, tool-call history, ReAct/ReActV2 tool agents, CodeAct execution loops, multimodal parts, native structured-output response formats, stop sequences if still unsupported, logprobs, and prompt-cache controls.

Implementation guidance:

- Keep unsupported feature errors typed and early.
- Do not make `dr-llm` silently ignore unsupported request fields.
- Make docs clear enough that a `dr-dspy` user can choose direct, pool, or plain LiteLLM without reading provider internals.

Acceptance checks:

- Docs list the supported and unsupported DSPy-facing feature surface.
- Tests still prove unsupported fields fail before opaque provider errors.

## Phase 8: Experiment Parity Guidance

Status: `done`

Do not collapse the two reviewed experiment families:

- `nl_latents` compression curves: raw `dr-llm`/pool workflow, raw single-user-message encoder and decoder prompts, pool grids, compression baselines, representation compression ratio against decoder pass rate.
- `nl-code` DSPy optimization and full-5x eval: legacy DSPy-style programs and optimizers, now needing a `TaskSpec`, explicit `RunContext`, and adapter-based port in `dr-dspy`.

Implementation guidance:

- For exact `nl_latents` replay, keep using `nl_latents` request builders or direct `dr-llm` `build_request_from_config()`-style construction.
- For new `dr-dspy` experiments, disclose that `Predict(TaskSpec)` prompt rendering is a new prompt condition unless a raw LM request path is used.
- For optimizer experiments, prefer `DrLlmDirectLM` until pool-backed cached sampling is an intentional condition. Optimizers can copy LMs and issue proposal calls with `n`; coordinate with `dr-dspy` on `n=1` and multi-completion behavior.

Acceptance checks:

- A doc section explains which path to use for exact replay versus new DSPy experiments.
- A final readiness note states which experiment family is ready to run immediately and which one remains native-only.

## Phase 9: Verification Commands

Status: `done`

Run the relevant checks in `dr-llm`. Update the command, result, and notes columns.

| Command | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `uv run pytest tests/backends/test_direct_backend.py tests/backends/test_pool_backend.py tests/backends/test_converters.py tests/backends/test_fingerprint.py tests/backends/test_validation.py tests/backends/test_async_bridge.py -q` | pass | Passed 39 tests on 2026-06-09. |
| Provider-control unit tests you added or updated | pass | `uv run pytest tests/backends/test_dr_dspy_contract.py tests/backends/test_pool_backend.py tests/backends/test_fingerprint.py tests/llm/providers/test_reasoning.py tests/llm/providers/test_llm_config.py -q` passed 101 tests on 2026-06-09. |
| Pool lifecycle/provenance tests you added or updated | pass | Same focused run passed; includes blank session ID and idempotent close tests. |
| Postgres pool integration test with `DR_LLM_TEST_DATABASE_URL` or `DR_LLM_DATABASE_URL` | pass | `./scripts/run-tests-local.sh` created temporary Docker Postgres and passed 62 integration tests on 2026-06-09. |
| Live OpenRouter smoke test against `openrouter/openai/gpt-5-nano` | pass | `uv run pytest tests/integration/test_live_openrouter.py -q -rs` passed 1 non-skipped live test, and `./scripts/run-tests-local.sh` also passed the checked-in live test with `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`. The paired dr-dspy `V-2` check should hit `DrLlmDirectLM("openrouter/openai/gpt-5-nano", ...)` and assert nonempty text plus OpenRouter provider/provenance metadata. |

If Postgres credentials are unavailable, mark only the Postgres row `blocked` and include the missing environment variable or service. The OpenRouter `gpt-5-nano` live test is part of the full acceptance bar; if `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is unexpectedly unavailable, mark the row `blocked`, explain the missing environment variable, and do not describe the plan as fully tested.

For the live OpenRouter test, add or run a checked-in live test when possible. A CLI smoke command is acceptable only for the dr-llm-side check if it verifies the response and provenance, for example an equivalent of `uv run dr-llm query --provider openrouter --model openai/gpt-5-nano --message "Return exactly: dr-llm live ok"` plus an assertion that the returned content is nonempty and came from the OpenRouter provider path. The paired `dr-dspy` `V-2` check must still hit OpenRouter through `DrLlmDirectLM("openrouter/openai/gpt-5-nano", ...)` or the direct dr-llm request path used by that bridge, then assert nonempty text and provider/provenance metadata strongly enough to catch accidental routing through another provider.

## Cross-Repo Readiness Checklist for dr-dspy

Status: `done`

Before declaring this done, write a short note for the `dr-dspy` implementer that answers:

- OpenRouter reasoning-off: set `provider=ProviderName.OPENROUTER`, the provider model string such as `xiaomi/mimo-v2-flash`, `reasoning=OpenRouterReasoning(enabled=False)`, and explicit experiment sampling when needed.
- OpenRouter provider-specific effort: set `reasoning=OpenRouterReasoning(effort=OpenRouterEffortLevel.LOW)` or another OpenRouter-supported effort. Do not rely on generic `BackendRequest.effort` as a substitute for the provider payload.
- OpenAI minimal thinking: set `provider=ProviderName.OPENAI`, `model="gpt-5-nano"`, `reasoning=OpenAIReasoning(thinking_level=ThinkingLevel.MINIMAL)`, and `sampling=None`.
- Google thinking-off: set `provider=ProviderName.GOOGLE`, `model="gemini-2.5-flash-lite"`, `reasoning=GoogleReasoning(thinking_level=ThinkingLevel.OFF)`, and explicit experiment sampling when needed.
- No sampling override is represented on the resolved request as `sampling=None`. Explicit sampling uses `SamplingControls(temperature=..., top_p=...)`. Empty authoring controls such as `SamplingControls(temperature=None, top_p=None)` resolve to `sampling=None`.
- Pool fingerprints include `provider`, `model`, `mode`, `messages`, `max_tokens`, `effort`, `reasoning`, and `sampling`; they exclude `metadata` and `extensions`.
- `DrLlmPoolLM` should pass an experiment-stable non-empty `session_id` to `PoolBackend.aacquire()`, for example `experiment-name:split:seed` or a caller-owned run ID. Metadata does not isolate claims.
- Builtin safe-load class paths are `dspy.clients.dr_llm.direct.DrLlmDirectLM` and `dspy.clients.dr_llm.pool.DrLlmPoolLM`.
- Builtin serialized dr-llm LM state fields are the base LM fields `_dspy_lm_class`, `model`, `model_type`, `num_retries`, `_dspy_provider_options`, optional `temperature`, optional `max_tokens`, plus `dr_llm_mode` and optional `dr_llm_provider_controls`.
- Pool LM state additionally stores `dr_llm_pool_config` as `PoolBackendConfig.model_dump(mode="json")` and optional `dr_llm_session_id`. Custom `registry` instances and pool `session_id_resolver` callables are not serialized; restored LMs rebuild the default registry and only restore an explicit session ID.
- Single-completion backend calls have no `n` field. For dr-dspy, unset `n` and `n=1` are equivalent for direct or cache-first completion. Native multi-completion is not supported on `DirectBackend.complete()` or `PoolBackend.complete()`; use `PoolBackend.acquire(..., n=...)` only for explicit no-replacement pool acquisition, otherwise reject or intentionally emulate `n>1` in dr-dspy.
- `PoolBackend.close()` is idempotent as of this change.
- Aggregate `AcquireResult(responses, claimed_from_cache, generated)` fields are stable; per-response `source`, `sample_id`, and `request_fingerprint` remain available when present.
- v1 remains text-only. Reject tools, tool history, multimodal parts, structured response formats, stop sequences, logprobs, prompt-cache controls, and unsupported reasoning shapes before provider calls.

## Original Review Findings Incorporated

This prompt incorporates the following review findings from the prior `dr-llm` final review:

- Cross-boundary coordination with `dr-dspy` disk log session identity, provider-specific reasoning gaps, DSPy prompt-shape differences, and pool fingerprint differences.
- Exact compression reproduction requires choosing between the raw `nl_latents`/`dr-llm` family and the DSPy optimizer family.
- The reviewed compression surface used MiMo, Nemotron, GPT-OSS 20B, GPT-5 nano, and Gemini Flash Lite with budgets `32`, `64`, `128`, `256`, `512`, and `1024`.
- The default T1 configs use `humaneval-plus`, budgets `64,128,256`, one encoder sample and one decoder sample per config, same-as-encoder decoder mode, and five default LLM config IDs:
  - `openrouter/xiaomi/mimo-v2-flash/off/v1`
  - `openrouter/nvidia/llama-3.3-nemotron-super-49b-v1.5/off/v1`
  - `openrouter/openai/gpt-5-nano/low/v1`
  - `openrouter/openai/gpt-oss-20b/low/v1`
  - `openai/gpt-5-nano/minimal/v1`
- Raw `nl_latents` encoder and decoder prompts are single user messages, not DSPy `Predict(TaskSpec)` prompts.
- `nl_latents` pools and `DrLlmPoolLM` pools use different seeding and keying systems.
- Pool acquisition depends on explicit stable session identity.
- Batch-fill remains a native `dr-llm` workflow.
- Pool fingerprints exclude metadata and extensions by design, but provider-output-affecting controls must be included.
- `dr-llm` v1 is intentionally text-only for the DSPy bridge.
- `LMConfig(n=1)` should map to ordinary single-completion behavior. `n>1` remains unsupported on direct/cache-first backend calls unless `dr-dspy` deliberately emulates it or uses explicit pool acquisition.
- `AcquireResult` aggregate provenance is already present in `dr-llm`; preserve it for future wrapper exposure.
